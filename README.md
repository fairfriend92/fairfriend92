Hi everyone, my name is Rodolfo. I began my research career at Imec/University of Antwerp as a junior researcher on AI. I then pursued a PhD in quantum materials for neuromorphic computing at the Laboratory of Solid State Physics, University of Paris-Saclay. During my PhD, I worked as teaching assistant for a computational neuroscience summer school and mentored several master’s students.

Post-PhD, I secured a €100K grant for developing a next-generation deep brain stimulation device, which is currently the object of a patent. My research has been published in leading peer-reviewed journals, including Science.

I am proficient in multiple programming languages (C, C++, C#, Java, Python, OpenCL) and hold a C1 English certificate and B1 French certificate. Italian is my native language.
Thank you for taking the time to take a look at my repositories!
