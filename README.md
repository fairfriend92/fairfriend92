Hi everyone, my name is Rodolfo and I'm a researcher in physics of strongly correlated electron systems and neuromorphic computing. My interest lies in studying novel quantum materials to build neuromorphic devices such as spiking neurons. I'm familiar with a number of programming languages, namely:

- C, C++
- Java, C#
- Python
- Mathematica, MatLab
- VHDL for digital hardware design (simple stuff, like a small SNN and a 4-bit CPU)
- OpenCL and MPI for parallel computation

Thank you for taking the time to take a look at my repositories!
